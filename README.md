# LLM Learning Odyssey

A personal journey documenting the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), from foundational concepts like Transformer architecture to advanced applications in fine-tuning and ethical AI. Includes notes, project summaries, and progress tracking.

## Learning Goals and Scope

*   **Learning Goals**: Clearly articulate the specific objectives.
